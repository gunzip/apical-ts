# Introduction

@apical-ts/craft effortlessly turn your OpenAPI specifications into
**fully-typed Zod v4 schemas** ready for runtime (client or server) validation
and TypeScript development.

You may ask,
"[Why another Typescript OpenAPI generator?](#why-another-generator)" The answer
lies in @apical-ts commitment to **strict type safety**. With @apical-ts/craft,
you get:

- no more unknown exceptions at runtime
- no more access to properties that can be `undefined`
- full support for multiple success responses (2xx) with payload
- full support for multiple content types (json, xml, form data, etc.)
- easy to debug operations with rich errors

## Quick Start

Get started with @apical-ts/craft in just a few commands:

```bash
# Generate schemas and client from an OpenAPI specification
npx @apical-ts/craft generate \
  --generate-server \
  --generate-client \
  -i https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json \
  -o generated

# Install runtime dependencies for the generated code
cd generated
npm install
```

This will create:

- **`server/`** - Typed handler wrappers
- **`client/`** - Individual operation functions for each API endpoint
- **`schemas/`** - Zod schemas and TypeScript types

:::note The generated client and server code requires `zod` as a runtime
dependency for schema validation. Make sure to install it in your project.

## Why another generator?

We all like the developer experience of [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), but not always
we're in control of the backend. OpenAPI specifications provide a powerful way
to define your API contracts, and with @apical-ts/craft, you can easily generate
TypeScript code that strictly adheres to those contracts, all while enjoying a
seamless developer experience.

Many existing generators lack flexibility and strong type safety. Most do not
support multiple success responses or multiple content types, and their typings
are often too loose‚Äîmaking it easy to accidentally access undefined properties.
With **stricter** guardrails, @apical-ts/craft helps developers (and Gen-AIs)
build more robust and reliable implementations.
